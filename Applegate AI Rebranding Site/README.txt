How to deploy:

Notes:
- This is a starter package that blends the content from your current Applegate AI homepage with the structure you provided from Arcscribe.
- Replace placeholder assets in /assets with your real logos and images.
- Replace contact form handling with Netlify Forms, Formspree, or your backend as needed.
- Update legal pages (privacy/terms) with counsel-reviewed text before going live.
